# snackSizeSims

Welcome! I love the Sims game so I made you a mini version. 

### How to Play:

1. You have made a brand new character, what will they do first? The options are Start a Career, Find a Friend, or Relax and Watch TV.
2. After each choice, you'll be presented with new options. Choose wisely as the choice will affect your character.
3. There are multiple decision points to creating a happy Sim. What will you choose?
